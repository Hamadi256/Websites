I have finally succeeded in adding Local Storage to the project. 

Sadly, the delete button is still causing some errors. The problem is that when you delete many elements in the same session, some stay.

I do not know the reason for this behaviour, but would appreciate someone telling me.

Other than that everything works properly. 

This time i did not depend on any tutorials and figured out everything by myself.

I will continue further improving. Maybe I'll buy a book about how to write cleaner code.

The "TodoYoutuber" file is what I had made with the help of a YouTube tutorial. All of the other files were made without any videos and solely with Google. Maybe next time I'll get the Expense Tracker to work with local storage. Either way, I love coding.
