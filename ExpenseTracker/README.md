I have added Local Storage here too. I didn't pay much attention to making it look good, and rather tried making it work properly.

Everything works, expect the delete Button. What I mean by this, is that when you try and delete for example, 10 elements in one session, 5 remain.

If you delete 5 rows in one session, 2 elements will remain on the next reload. 

I do not know what is causing this. Help would be greatly appreciated.
